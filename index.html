<h1> What is neuromorphic computing? </h1>
<p><i> Neuromorphic computing</i>, also known as neuromorphic engineering, is an emerging technology inspired by the human brain. 
  <br>It is meant to <b>replicate</b> the structure and function of a human brain. 
  <br> Unlike more <b>traditional computer engineering</b>, it draws from biology and neuroscience. 
  <br> Conventional processors rely on sequential, high-power computation; <b>Neuromorphic systems</b> are meant to process similarly to neurons and synapses, event-driven, parallel, and adaptive. 
  <br> These <i>euromorphic computers</i> are meant to be extremely energy efficient, have real-time decision-making, greater adaptability and machine learning, and better parallel processing or multitasking.</p>
